1. What is an exception?
(Represents errors that occur during application execution.)

2. What happens in a try block if the 
program executes without errors?
)If the finally block was executing during the handling of an 
earlier exception then that first exception is lost. )

3. How does the catch mechanism work 
for unhandled exceptions?
(It throws exception that is not handled. This should crash your application)

4. What happens in a program if an 
exception block fails to handle an 
particular error?
(an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a
 pre-registered exception handler.)

5. What is the parent class for all 
exceptions? How does this work?
(


6. How do you determine the type of an
 error? 
(It will display an error, syntax, logical.)

7. What is the purpose of integer
 checking?

8. What does the finally block do?
(the code has to make it into the triblock, it doesnt matter what happens it will run)
